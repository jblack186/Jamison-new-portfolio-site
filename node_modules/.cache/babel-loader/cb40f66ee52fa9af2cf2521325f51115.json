You can also use “transition” to delay animations and specify the duration.\nFramermotion has excellent documentation https://www.framer.com/api/motion/. There is so much you can do with this tool. From cleaning up the code to animating an entire page when a component loads. We’ve barely scratched the surface here. Utilize this in your next project!</p>\n      </div>\n      <div className='post-container'>\n        <h1 className='blog-header'>Script tags inside a react component</h1>\n        <div className='medium-about'>\n          <p className='blog-about'>By Jamison Blackwell</p>\n          <a href='https://medium.com/@blackwellj1040/script-tags-inside-a-react-component-5ec686ae5064' className='blog-medium'>Published here on Medium</a>\n        </div>\n        <img className='blog-img' src={Frame} />\n        <p className='blog-body'>I ran into this problem when I was trying to use some vanilla javascript code I found on codepen in a react project. I didn’t want to refactor it and wanted to just plop it right into my component. Luckily react has a ScriptTag feature that solves this.\nAll you need to do is type npm install react-script-tag into the terminal.\nThen type — import ScriptTag from ‘react-script-tag’ — on the top of the component.\nSlap it in your code. Just use ScriptTag in place for script and for type put it equal to text/javascript\nAnd you’re ready to go. It’s that easy.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <Link style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}  to='/dashboard' > <div >\n    {<FontAwesomeIcon className='arrow-left' icon={faChevronLeft}/> }\n\n    </div></Link>\n\n    </motion.div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Blog;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
